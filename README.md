In the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) for medical diagnosis, image segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying and outlining anatomical structures, tumors, and abnormalities in medical images such as MRI, CT, and X-rays. Loss functions are mathematical formulas used during model training to measure how well the predicted segmentation maps match the ground truth annotations.

This project involves developing a Python program to implement and compare various loss functions specifically designed for medical image segmentation tasks. These functions guide the learning process by penalizing incorrect predictions, helping the model to improve its accuracy.

Common loss functions used in medical segmentation include:

Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) – Measures pixel-wise classification error.

Dice Loss – Focuses on overlap between predicted and true regions, useful in imbalanced datasets.

Jaccard Loss (IoU Loss) – Similar to Dice, but penalizes false positives more heavily.

Tversky Loss – A generalized form of Dice loss that provides control over false positives and false negatives.

By comparing these loss functions on sample data, we can understand their behavior and choose the most suitable one for different types of medical segmentation problems.
